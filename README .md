# Candidar - AI Mock Interview Platform
## Abstract
**Candidar** is an AI-powered platform designed to help job seekers enhance their interview skills through real-time mock interviews and personalized feedback.

Just as  **dar - دار** is a space of comfort and growth, Candidar provides an environment for individuals to refine their interview abilities, build confidence, and prepare for professional success. By simulating realistic interviews specific to different job roles and offering insightful feedback, Candidar equips users with the necessary tools to navigate the competitive **Moroccan job market** and stand out to potential employers.
